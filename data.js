The collection also covers the social sciences, especially anthropology, criminology, education, political science, psychology, sociology, and women's studies.

Only a few titles are held in subjects where a specialized reading room exists such as business, music, law, and science and technology.</div><div><br></div><div>The MRR collection contains over 16,000 titles in about 56,000 volumes. The books are on open shelves in the alcoves (MRR Alc) of the Main Reading Room on both the main floor and the first balcony; on Decks 7, 46, and 16 adjacent to the reading room; and in the Reference Assistance Room (MRR Ref Desk) as you enter the reading room.
